The article [Study analyzes personality traits of bullies, victims](https://medicalxpress.com/news/2011-02-personality-traits-bullies-victims.html) found that both victims of bullying and bullies themselves tend to have low self-compassion.

The wonderful thing about self-compassion is that it can be worked on, and increased. It is a skill that can be learned and improved.

This was the catalyst for creating Kind Cloud. Loving-kindness meditation has a self-compassion building component along with extending good will to those you know and don't know.

We wanted a way to prevent bullying by helping both victims and bullies be kinder to themselves to break the cycle.

Kind Cloud steps you through a Loving-kindness meditation to make it easier to be kind to yourself and to others.
