Loving-kindness meditation today or "Metta" focuses on rings of compassion and wishing good things to a set of groups.

## How it works

#### Say kind things to...

- ⭐️ Yourself
- ❤️ A loved one
- ⚪️ A neutral party
- ⚡️ Someone you find difficult
- A larger community

#### You say the same phrase to each group

- "May I be filled with peace and ease" (oneself)
- "May you be filled with peace and ease" (loved one, neutral person, and difficult person)
- "May all living things be filled with peace and ease" (community)

Take your time on each phrase until you can truly wish it each group.

#### TIP

If you are going through a very tough time,don't select your arch-nemisis on your first try. Rather get comfortable with the phrases and format and work your way towards that person over time and when you are ready.
