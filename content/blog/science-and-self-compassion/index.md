Researchers have been keenly interested in self-compassion and loving-kindness these days, which is lovely!

One such article summarizes many of these studies in [18 Science-Backed Reasons to Try Loving-Kindness Meditation](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/feeling-it/201409/18-science-backed-reasons-try-loving-kindness-meditation)!

I was going to try to summarize the article but it is so good, I think it should be read in its entirety!
