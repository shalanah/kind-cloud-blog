There are lots of meditation apps out there, and with good reason.

Meditation has proven to help [relieve anxiety and depression](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2014/01/07/260470831/mindfulness-meditation-can-help-relieve-anxiety-and-depression) and may have other benefits too.

But why do we need another?

Kind Cloud is different. It is sound-free by design.

## Sound-free benefits

### Go at your own indvidual pace ⭐️

Most meditations involve listening to someone else guide you.

They might be great at pausing at the exact right time and have selected the perfect background music to keep you focused. But for some, the timing is a bit off, and not with their own individual rhythm.

Kind Cloud allows you to move on exactly when you're ready.

Go as slowly or as quickly as you'd like.

No judgement here.

### Helpful for deaf and hard of hearing individuals or those with noise sensitivities 🔇

Audio can be a challenge for many, and completely inaccessible for others. Kind Cloud is your meditation companion.

### I hope you find a meditation app that works for you! 🌈

May you be filled with loving-kindness. 💙
