There are lots of meditation apps out there, and with good reason.

Meditation has proven to help [relieve anxiety and depression](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2014/01/07/260470831/mindfulness-meditation-can-help-relieve-anxiety-and-depression) and may have other benefits too.

But why do we need another?

Kind Cloud is different. It is sound-free by design.

### Sound-free benefits

#### Go at your own pace ‚≠êÔ∏è

Most meditations involve listening to someone else guide you.

They might be great at pausing at the exact right time and have selected the perfect background music to keep you focused. But, for some, the timing is a bit off, and does not fit their own personal rhythm.

Kind Cloud allows you to move on exactly when you're ready.

Go as slowly or as quickly as you'd like.

#### For individuals with noise sensitivity ‚≠êÔ∏è

Finding the right meditaiton voice and music can take time. Remove it from the equation entirely with text.

#### For deaf and hard of hearing individuals ‚≠êÔ∏è

Audio can be a challenge for many, and completely inaccessible for others. Kind Cloud is your meditation companion.

##### Give Kind Cloud a try! If it doesn't work for you, I hope you find another meditation type that does. üåà
